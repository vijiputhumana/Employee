<p><strong>Information Security</strong> is not only about securing
information from unauthorized access. Information Security is basically
the practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of
information. Information can be physical or electronic one. Information
can be anything like Your details or we can say your profile on social
media, your data in mobile phone, your biometrics etc. Thus Information
Security spans so many research areas like Cryptography, Mobile
Computing, Cyber Forensics, Online Social Media etc. </p>
<p>During First World War, Multi-tier Classification System was
developed keeping in mind sensitivity of information. With the beginning
of Second World War formal alignment of Classification System was done.
Alan Turing was the one who successfully decrypted Enigma Machine which
was used by Germans to encrypt warfare data. </p>
<p>Information Security programs are build around 3 objectives, commonly
known as CIA – Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability. <br />

<li><p><strong>Confidentiality –</strong> means information is not
disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities and process. For example
if we say I have a password for my Gmail account but someone saw while I
was doing a login into Gmail account. In that case my password has been
compromised and Confidentiality has been breached.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrity –</strong> means maintaining accuracy and
completeness of data. This means data cannot be edited in an
unauthorized way. For example if an employee leaves an organisation then
in that case data for that employee in all departments like accounts,
should be updated to reflect status to JOB LEFT so that data is complete
and accurate and in addition to this only authorized person should be
allowed to edit employee data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Availability –</strong> means information must be
available when needed. For example if one needs to access information of
a particular employee to check whether employee has outstanded the
number of leaves, in that case it requires collaboration from different
organizational teams like network operations, development operations,
incident response and policy/change management. <br />
Denial of service attack is one of the factor that can hamper the
availability of information.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from this there is one more principle that governs information
security programs. This is Non repudiation. </p>
